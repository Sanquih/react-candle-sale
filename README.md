# Candle Sale

This responsive webpage, made with React and libraries such as Redux, react-router-dom, react-hook-form, and Zod, provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for creating and ordering your own custom aromatic candles. Users can select their preferred essences, sizes, and styles, ensuring a personalized product that meets their needs. The design prioritizes ease of navigation and responsiveness, creating an enjoyable shopping experience.

## With this project, I practiced

- **Redux:** To efficiently manage the global state of the application, particularly for managing the cart and candle customization options.
- **Style Modules:**
  - Used CSS Modules to scope styles locally to each component, ensuring style conflicts were avoided and the project maintained a clean and modular structure.
  - Enhanced the maintainability of the codebase by defining styles directly within their respective components, allowing better alignment with Reactâ€™s component-based architecture.
- **react-router-dom:** To navigate between pages, ensuring smooth transitions and a clear structure for different sections of the site.
- **Custom hooks:**
  - Encapsulated and reused logic for fetching data such as available essences, styles, and sizes.
  - Implemented logic for creating a new candle, assigning it to the currently active customization session, and managing the entire workflow of a user's interaction with a candle.
  - Designed hooks to handle the process of generating and sending the order message to ensure users can confirm their selections and finalize their purchase seamlessly.
- **react-hook-form and Zod:**
  - To build and validate forms for user interactions. For instance, the form used for specifying candle quantities was tightly controlled with Zod schemas to ensure type safety and proper validation rules.
  - Streamlined error handling and improved the user experience with dynamic feedback for form inputs.

## Development server
